5. IF CAPTCHA is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide testable bypass mechanisms for automation

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Content Management

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want dynamic data tables and real-time content, so that I can test complex data interactions and live updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data tables THEN the system SHALL provide filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities
2. WHEN performing data operations THEN the system SHALL support full CRUD functionality for user profiles
3. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL display live notifications and infinite scroll features
4. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL update content dynamically for testing async operations

### Requirement 4: API Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want comprehensive API endpoints, so that I can perform integration and performance testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for CRUD operations
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL support GET /users, POST /users, PUT /users/{id}, DELETE /users/{id}
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL simulate latency and failure states
4. WHEN performing load testing THEN the system SHALL handle multiple concurrent API requests

### Requirement 5: Interactive UI Components

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want rich interactive UI components, so that I can test complex user interface interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide modals, tooltips, accordions, sliders, and carousels
2. WHEN elements receive focus THEN the system SHALL implement hover, focus, and active states for automation detection
3. WHEN accessed on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. WHEN testing cross-browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL function consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

### Requirement 6: JavaScript Interactivity

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want JavaScript-based interactions, so that I can test modern web application behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL handle JavaScript validations and transitions
2. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations detectable by automation tools
3. WHEN testing UI frameworks THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright
4. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate JavaScript events for testing

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can test error scenarios and logging mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing invalid pages THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 500, etc.)
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide server-side logging simulation
3. WHEN system alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL create console errors for monitoring framework testing
4. WHEN testing error capture THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for error reporting validation

### Requirement 8: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want role-based authentication, so that I can test access control and security scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support Admin, User, and Guest roles
2. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL handle tokens and cookies for login/logout workflow testing
3. WHEN testing authorization THEN the system SHALL restrict access based on user roles
4. WHEN security testing THEN the system SHALL provide testable authentication mechanisms

### Requirement 9: Performance Testing Components

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want performance-intensive features, so that I can conduct load and stress testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with large datasets THEN the system SHALL handle 1000+ products or users
2. WHEN performing load testing THEN the system SHALL provide data-heavy search and chat features
3. WHEN testing file operations THEN the system SHALL support large file upload and download
4. WHEN stress testing THEN the system SHALL maintain performance under high-load conditions

### Requirement 10: Test Automation Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want properly structured elements, so that I can easily target them with automation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are created THEN the system SHALL provide unique IDs, classes, and data attributes
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL include ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN automation scripts run THEN the system SHALL provide custom event hooks for interaction
4. WHEN using test frameworks THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, and TestCafe
